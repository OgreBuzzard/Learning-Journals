# Day 5 Learning Journal

I actually enjoyed the lab today. The logic snapped into place for me relatively quickly and I was able to get the tests to complete after only a few tries. I made an effort to help the students around me who were stuck, but I think that's a skill I need to work on. I'm not sure if I was doing a bad job of explaining things, or maybe I was being arrogant or too eager. I don't know, but I'm not going to worry about it too much. I'm mostly just glad to be done.

Still way behind on the reading. Not even thinking about the stretch goals or polishing my About Me. I've gotta spend time with my family this weekend and get rest for next week.
