# Learning Journal Day 12

Got the salmon cookie project finished up. Spent a couple hours with Bhavya and got through some of the Bus Mall project. Still haven't got the data tracking going and didn't even start on the chart. Halloween, so didn't get to do any work at night. Falling pretty far behind and getting stressed.
