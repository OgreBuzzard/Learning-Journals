# Learning Journal Day 13

Caught up on the first two days of the Bus Mall project. Haven't even started the third. Am going through other requirements that are due tomorrow, or that I've fallen behind on, before I start tackling today's challenge, which seems to have given the rest of the class big headaches.

One bit of good news: my code works. No bugs. And I understand it. So that's all good.
