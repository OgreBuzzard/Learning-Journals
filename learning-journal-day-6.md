# Day 6 Learning Journal

This lab was super duper hard. I'm exhausted. Gotta go to sleep an hour ago to get enough rest to make it through class tomorrow.

Figured out how to display the sales for each store with lots of help from the TA. Went home and finished up all the details. The rules of what you can do inside of objects vs outside objects are hard to get the hang of. Figuring out where to put the console log, what to return in a function, when to call the function, and so on... Ugh.

Got it, though. It works.
