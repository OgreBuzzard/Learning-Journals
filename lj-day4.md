# Day 4 Learning Journal

I was behind on the previous day's lab, so I caught up during the morning lecture, which meant I missed some of the lecture on functions. I was able to focus more on the Box Model lecture in CodePen, but I don't know that I retained much.

The pair programming was great. We cranked through that pretty fast. I think Dean and I both agreed the stretch goals are beyond our capability right now. I'd rather spend the extra time catching up on the reading.

I'm way behind on the reading. It's stressing me out. It's always there, waiting to eat up any extra time I have, and it always takes me longer than I think to get through each chapter. I'd love to just breeze through it, but it's a lot of stuff I don't know or only partially understand.
