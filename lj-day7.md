# Day 7 Learning Journal

Got the Constructor Function project working. A lot of debugging. A lot of staring blankly at the screen. A lot of help from the TAs. Was up until 11pm getting the basic spec working, then another hour on the stretch goal. Finished and resubmitted the stretch goal during the morning lecture.

I get it so far. I understand what's going on and how my code works. So that's good.
