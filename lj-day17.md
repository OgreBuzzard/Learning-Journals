# Learning Journal Day 17

Got my buttons hooked up on the student page. Did some fancy configuration to make one of the buttons flip to a different button once it's triggered. Was very satisfying once it started working. Kevin is still walking me through all the code stuff I'm adding. I understand the changes I'm making, but I can't quite generate the steps on my own.

Would definitely be lost without the more experienced people on my team.
