# Learning Journal Day 16

Got in the TA line project with Dean, Kevin, and Roger. It's a good project and a great group to be in. Kevin came in over the weekend and laid out all the groundwork for the project, so we've been ahead from the start. He has been leading the project and helping me step through the small chunks that I have to work on.

I don't have a firm grasp on how our project fits together, but I've got a handle on my piece and I'm picking it up as I go.
