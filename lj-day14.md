# Learning Journal Day 14

Okay. I've got one reading assignment to catch up on and I've gotta take the 301 entrance exam this weekend, but all the other labs are out of the way and I'm ready to focus on the final group project next week. Week 3 was actually harder than week 2 for me. I think I tried to be a little more independent this week, and then realized I was overconfident and didn't really know how to fly on my own yet. By the time I figured that out, I'd fallen behind and it's been a struggle to catch up.

I've got a great group and a solid project concept. I think that's going to go well and have been enjoying the process so far. Everyone in my group communicates clearly and no one seems to dominate by being loudest or talking faster, and no one seems inclined to run off and do a bunch of stuff without communicating it to the group. I'm not the strongest coder in the group and will try to figure out the ways I can contribute best and learn from them.
